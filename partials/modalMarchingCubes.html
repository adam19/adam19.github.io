			During my first semester of my Masters program at USC I was enrolled 
			in a graphics development course where we learned the typical rendering 
			pipeline for rasterizing triangles. Our final project was to find any 
			white paper and implement it. Myself and a couple of fellow students 
			found a paper describing the Marching-Cubes algorithm.
		</p>
		<p>
			We started by generating three-dimensional Perlin noise. This provided us 
			with a 3D point-cloud of varying values. We filtered the values by an 
			arbitrary value of 0.5, and discarded the lower values. The remaining points 
			were run through our Marching-Cubes algorithm. We checked each cell in the cloud 
			to see if it had neighboring cells that were occupied. If a cell had neighbors 
			on all sides we would skip it. If it had some empty spots surrounding it 
			we would mark it as a surface. We did a final pass over the data and generated 
			triangles based on whether or not they were surfaces points. There were 256 
			possible permutations of the final geometry for a cell, but we were able to 
			narrow it down to 8 with different rotations.   
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the geometry was generated we would export it as an OBJ file so we could 
			examine it in Maya. We also took the geometry and compiled it into a series of 
			triangle lists that we could render in OpenGL. I added controls for the Xbox 360 
			controller so the user could fly through the final mesh generated from the 
			3D Perlin noise.   
		</p>
		<p>
			The application was developed using only C++ and OpenGL.
